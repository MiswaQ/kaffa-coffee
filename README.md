# Kaffa Coffee

Kaffa Coffee is a potential Ethiopian coffee shop that I have built as my e-commerce specialization Project Portfolio 5 for my diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute. 
This webshop is built for coffee lovers, from “the kingdom of kaffa” (i.e. Ethiopia), where the origin of coffee started. The webshop is simple and straight to the point, with a shop page, about page and of course a sign up page so that the users can sign up for newsletters and get all the updates about the business and if there is any new coffee available.

## Planning
At the beginning of this project I started out with these three questions to get a better idea of what type of application I wanted to build, and the outcome is as follows:
<br>
<br>
**Who is the customer?** B2C - Business to Customer
<br>
**What will they buy?** Products
<br>
**How will they pay?** Single payment
<br>
<br>
Then I followed up with these three questions to plan my e-commerce application:
<br>
- **Which e-commerce application types apply to this online business?**
  <br> B2C, Products, Single payments
- **With the e-commerce application types in mind, what kind of features might be included within the business website?**
  <br> Easy Payment, Authentication System for users to log in/out and access their relevant data, Authentication with social accounts for easier registration, Search Function, Images, Product Description, Ratings/Reviews, Contact Form, Shopping Cart and Payment System
- **What tables of data would my database need, and what data might be included in these tables?**
  <br> User: username, email, password
  <br> Product: name, image, price, description, size, rating
  <br> Order: User, total, full_name, address
  <br> OrderItem: Order, Product, quantity

## Features
I have just started off with my project. Because of medical leave and parental leave I have lost some time and fallen behind.
But this is approximently the way I want it to look when the project is finished. All of the images comes from my wireframes and this is how I am imagin it to look like.

### Navigation bar

### Landing page

### Bundles

### About page

### Register / Sign in page

### Footer

## Design
I decided to have a dark themed website as I feel that it resembles the dark coffee and gives the site a nice feeling. The links also have a nice touch with the bright colors from the Ethiopian flag, green, yellow and red.
<br>
<br>
The homepage gives the users a small introduction about this business and also states the favorite coffees. For the users to get interested in buying some of those coffees. Or get interested in seeing what more this business has to offer.
